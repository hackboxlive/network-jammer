# Network-jammer

Network-jammer tries to search up every connected devices on the local network, and then starts to send deauthentication packets to all of them synchronously. It works as if it jams the wifi, as it prevents other devices from pinging the network. 

It also includes a white-list, which the tool user can create to let those devices be safe from the deauth attack.

Hope you enjoy the maximum bandwidth. :)
